# Pylontech Battery Monitoring via WiFi

This project allows you to control and monitor Pylontech US2000B and US2000C batteries via console port over WiFi.
It it's a great starting point to integrate battery with your home automation.

**I ACCEPT NO RESPONSIBILTY FOR ANY DAMAGE CAUSED, PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK**

# Features:
  * Low cost (around 20$ in total).
  * Adds WiFi capability to your Pylontech US2000B/C battery.
  * Device exposes web interface that allows to:
    * send console commands and read response over WiFi (no PC needed)
    * battery information can be retrevied also in JSON format for easy parsing
  * MQTT support:
    * device pushes basic battery data like SOC, temperature, state, etc to selected MQTT server
  * Easy to modify code using Arduino IDE and flash new firmware over WiFi (no need to disconnect from the battery).

# Parts needed and schematics:
  * [Wemos D1 mini microcontroller](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Makerfire-NodeMcu-Development-ESP8266-Compatible/dp/B071S8MWTY/).
  * [SparkFun MAX3232 Transceiver](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11189).
  * US2000B: Cable with RJ10 connector (some RJ10 cables have only two wires, make sure to buy one that has all four wires present).
  * US2000C: Cable with RJ45 connector (see below for more details).
  * Capacitors C1: 10uF, C2: 0.1uF (this is not strictly required, but recommended as Wemos D1 can have large current spikes).

# US2000C notes:
This battery uses RJ45 cable instead of RJ10. Schematics is the same only plug differs:
  * RJ45 Pin 3 (white-green) = R1IN
  * RJ45 Pin 6 (green)       = T1OUT
  * RJ45 Pin 8 (brown)       = GND

# How to get going:
  * Get Wemos D1 mini
  * Install arduino IDE and ESP8266 libraries as [described here](https://averagemaker.com/2018/03/wemos-d1-mini-setup.html)
  * Open [PylontechMonitoring.ino](PylontechMonitoring.ino) in arduino IDE
  * Make sure to copy content of [libraries subdirectory](libraries) to [libraries of your Arduino IDE](https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=88380.0).
  * Specify your WiFi login and password at the top of the file (line 13-14)
  * If you want MQTT support, uncomment line 17 and fill details in lines 21-24
  * Upload project to your device
  * Connect Wemos D1 mini to the MAX3232 transreceiver
  * Connect transreceiver to RJ10/RJ45 as descibed in the schematics (all three lines need to be connected)
  * Connect RJ10/RJ45 to the serial port of the Pylontech US2000 battery. If you have multiple batteries - connect to the master one.
  * Connect Wemos D1 to the power via USB
  * Find what IP address was assigned to your Wemos by your router and open it in the web-browser
  * You should be able now to connunicate with the battery via WiFi
